/**
   * This function template is similar to std::min_element but can be used when the comparison
   * involves computing a derived quantity (a.k.a. distance). This algorithm will search for the
   * the element in the range [first,last) which has the "smallest" distance (of course, both the
   * distance metric and comparison can be overriden to perform something other than the canonical
   * Euclidean distance and less-than comparison, which would yield the element with minimum distance).
   * \tparam DistanceValueType The value-type for the distance measures.
   * \tparam DistanceFunctionType The functor type to compute the distance measure.
   * \tparam CompareFunctionType The functor type that can compare two distance measures (strict weak-ordering).
