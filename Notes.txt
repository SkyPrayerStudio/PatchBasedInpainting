Trying to fill patch (271, 385) at iteration 32. Patch (282, 401) continues the shadow properly with score 12662, but "best match" (285, 355) has score 7508.


---------------------------------------------
Testing solid patch (concrete) vs siding. Determination is that blurring is what was causing these to match well.

Target patch (193, 218) matches to (400, 7) with SSD 660.938 matches VERY poorly visually, but is the best match.
(319, 292) seems to be a much better match...
