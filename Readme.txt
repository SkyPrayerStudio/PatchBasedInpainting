This software allows the user to inpaint an image using a texture synthesis based method.
This implementation is based on "Object Removal By Exemplar Based Inpainting" by A. Criminisi.

Notes:
Through the code, the size of square patches are described by their "radius". That is, a 9x9 square patch has radius 4.
